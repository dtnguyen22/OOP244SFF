1. when i tried to put template function definition in seperate .cpp file and compile it, 
there is errors: unresolved external 
If I move all the template function definition to .h file, it will compile all the files
successfully.
For example, template Readrow function:
what compiler is doing here is, it finds the function declaration in .h file for function call
in main file to replace each appearance of T to the actual type passed to the function call.
If we seperate template function its implementation. 
I think complier only replaces T in header file, not in the implementation file,
which means function call can not find its implementation and leads to UNRESOVLED external error. 
2. Yes we can put read, readrow and display above main function to make it run, but we have to 
put it in namespace sict or use resolution opeprator to prevent the compiler from confusing.
3.Yes I can do i without templates but it will have a lot of code duplication.
Using template is better for functions which have same logic but different parameter type.
4. Yes they are quivalent.
